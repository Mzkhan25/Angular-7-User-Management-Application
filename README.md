# User-Management-Application

This application demonstrates the basic use of User Management portal. 

I implemented it using 

* Nest Js
* Angular Js
* Mongoose DB


## To run server

* Ensure that you have mongoose DB installed and running. In-case you don't, you can install it from [Here ](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)

* go into server directory and run command "npm i"
* once all packages are installed, give the command "npm run start:dev". This will start your server on localhost:8080
* You can see the Swagger documentation of api at http://localhost:8080/api/docs 

## To run client

* go into client directory and run command "npm i"
* once all packages are installed, give the command "ng serve". This will host your client http://localhost:4200



### Future steps
* Implement update and delete functionality
* Implement graphs 



### Shoutout
A huge shoutout to [Chau Tran](https://github.com/nartc/nest-mean). His code and his youtube tutorial helped me in not only setting the NEST JS server but also basic UI for client.
